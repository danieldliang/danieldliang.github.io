    <header>Hey, my name is Daniel Liang. Welcome to my website!</header>

    <body>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <br>I'm a high schooler interested in computer science and engineering, computational biology, competitive programming, and running.</br>
        
        <br>But that's not all. Fitting one's self-interests into four narrow categories seems pretty suffocating in my opinion (Besides, who even creates the bounds to these categories? Not me, that's for sure.).</br>
        
        <br>I'll enjoy a good CS, math, and occasionally physics problem/puzzle. Or almost any such puzzle that makes me think logically and creatively. I guess the subject doesn't matter much.</br>

        <br>One of my life-long goals is to get good. One of my (hopefully) short-term goals is making USACO Platinum.</br>

        <center>Assuming I actively maintain this website, expect to see my <a href="usaco/usaco.html">USACO solutions</a>, <a href="videos/videos.html">video clips</a> (coding tutorials, gaming, running, violin... etc.), <a href="blog/blog.html">blog posts</a> (of life updates), and <a href="miscellaneous/miscellaneous.html">whatever else I like doing in life at the time</a> (and I feel like posting).</center>
