    <header>Hey, my name is Daniel Liang. Welcome to my website!</header>

            <p>
            <br>I'm a competitive programmer, researcher, runner, and some more!</br>
            
            <br>Interested in machine learning and its applications in healthcare.</br>
            
            <br>But that's not all. Fitting one's self-interests into four narrow categories seems pretty suffocating in my opinion (Besides, who even creates the bounds to these categories? Not me, that's for sure.).</br>
            
            <br>I'll enjoy a game of blitz chess, or a good CS, math, and physics problem. Or almost any puzzle that makes me think logically and creatively. I guess the subject doesn't matter much.</br>
    
            <br>One of my life-long goals is to get good. One of my (hopefully) short-term goals is making USACO Platinum.</br>

        <center>Assuming I actively maintain this website, expect to see my <a href="stuff/usaco/usaco.html">USACO solutions</a>, <a href="stuff/videos/videos.html">video clips</a> (coding tutorials, gaming, running, violin... etc.), <a href="stuff/blog/blog.html">blog posts</a> (of life updates), and <a href="stuff/miscellaneous/miscellaneous.html">whatever else I like doing in life at the time</a> (and I feel like posting).</center>
