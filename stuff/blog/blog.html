Hello everyone. I remembered I had a blog. Anyways, spring break has begun!
Here's a recap of how my junior yr's been going:


:(

    
With that settled, I think it's time to set up some goals over break so I don't 
turn into a couch potato :D
- Study for APs and finals. Get the grades up.
- Secure some research program/internship over the summer. Kinda threw on this one
    but I got a few opportunities left.
- Re-learn Java.
- Get (slightly) started on olympiads (USACO, AMC) again. Aiming for Platinum and AMC 12 Distinction
    by the time the olympiads roll around next school year.
- Make the Bobotics Scouter App thingymabob.
OK thats all. Have a nice day yall.
